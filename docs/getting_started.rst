Getting Started Using Python
****************************
The most fundamental part of the project is the Python module, which takes care of all the heavy lifting. 
You can install it easily through PIP from Pypi: :code:`pip install itr`.

The typical end-user use cases have all been removed to the :code:`ITR-examples` package.  Please see documentation there for running and writing Jupyter notebooks and using the :code:`itr-ui` graphical user interface.

The :code:`ITR` package retains a variety of unit tests that developers should be familiar with (and contribute to as they develop and contribute their own functionality to the project).  You can run :code:`pytest test` to verify that your installation is working as expected.

The `API reference <https://os-c.github.io/ITR/autoapi/index.html>`_ should provide a clear overview of the module's API and its usage.
