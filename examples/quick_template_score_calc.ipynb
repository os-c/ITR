    "# ITR Tool - Template Temperature Score Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple example of the ITR Toolkit as a means to evaluate Portfolio Alignment.  Text boxes (called Markdown cells) like this provide some explanation, and then code cells either do the work just explained or will do work that will be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data needed to run this demonstration should be local and no acccess to the internet should be required.  However, if you want to delete a file and re-download it (to restore to its pristine state), of course you need access to the internet, and you will need a github token to access the OS-Climate hithub.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sample Data template** provides both a *Read me* sheet and sheet of data dictionary *Definitions*, as well as three input data sheets:\n",
    "* ITR input data: The fundamental financial, emissions, and production data of companies, listed by security instrument as company id\n",
    "* ITR target input data: Short-term Emissions or Intensity reduction targets and Net-Zero attainment target dates, listed by company id\n",
    "* Portfolio: A list of positions and investment value amounts\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may choose **Benchmark Data** that forecasts intensity reductions expected from 2020-2050 by region and sector.  By default we use the OECM benchmark, but two TPI benchmarks are also available.  In all three cases we use the same projections for production grwoth forecasts.  We also use the same global carbon budget and TCRE multipliers for all benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After scoring the portfolio, the portfolio is copied to the local file *data_dump.xlsx* which can be downloaded for further analysis.\n",
